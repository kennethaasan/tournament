# Football Tournament Administration App

This is a football tournament administration app that I originally made with Laravel as a student in 2014 ish. I've moved it to the `laravel` folder. I intend to replace it with a modern TypeScript application using Next.js and AI tools like Codex. I will use [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) to help settle on new requirements and design before implmentation. I recently did the same modernization for another app, which you can find [here](https://github.com/kennethaasan/mattis). The AI tools can use that repository as a reference.
